Harnessing this pathway may offer innovative approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.	ND
However, interestingly, co-expression of upstream Tg domains, either in cis or in trans, overrides the dimerization defect of such a mutant.	ND
These results, as well as publicly available transcriptional profiles, were analyzed using both network inference and cluster analysis algorithms.	ND
HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States).	ND

A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A).	ND
Each of the major components of this mechanism may become deregulated in cancer, and accumulating evidence points to the 'pRb pathway' as a candidate obligatory target in multistep oncogenesis of possibly all human tumor types.	[pathway | Pathway][pRb | Gene_or_gene_product | Participant = pathway]
The transgenic flies display ocular fluid discharge, reflecting ocular hypertension, and a progressive decline in their behavioral responses to light.	ND
In contrast, no PCR signal was received with a primer pair recognizing a region in the A3G gene approximately4000 bp downstream of the Sp1/Sp3-binding site (Figure 6C, lower panel).	ND

However, important pathogens such as Brucella melitensis, P. aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi seem to be exceptional as they possess only the PCS pathway for PC formation.	ND
Background values from each lane were subtracted to normalize each measurement.	ND
Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL.	[regulated | Regulation][RALDH2 | Protein | Theme = regulated][TAL1 | Protein | Cause = regulated]
