MIP1 alpha nuclear protein (MNP), a novel transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells that is crucial for transcription of the human MIP-1 alpha gene. Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) and its human equivalent (GOS19, LD78, or AT464)
These results not only identify a coactivator molecule that modulates TR activity, but also uncover a role for Rb in a pathway that responds to thyroid hormone.
structural basis for the oxygen-insertion step of hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by diiron proteins.
Cytolytic activity was blocked by incubation with 2 mM EGTA (not depicted), confirming involvement of the granule exocytosis (perforin-granzyme B) pathway.
Daily i.p. injections of HAH-cortisol into mice bearing s.c.
(2006) report that the kinases GSK3 and AMPK cooperate in the activation of TSC2 to inhibit mTOR activity.
IL-18BP abolished IL-18 induction of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), IL-8, and activation of NF-kappaB in vitro.
sensitizes cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.
In un-stimulated cells, the p65 DNA binding (Figure 2A) and nuclear p65 (Figure 2B, nucleus) were slightly enhanced by Tat, while the IkappaB-alpha content was not significantly affected (Figure 2B, cytosol).
We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this regulatory sequence as a potential tool to inhibit GM-CSF gene transcription.
New insights into pocket protein regulation have also been obtained.
Characterization of two novel proteins, NgRH1 and NgRH2, structurally and biochemically homologous to the Nogo-66 receptor.
GABP factors bind to a distal interleukin 2 (IL-2) enhancer and contribute to c-Raf-mediated increase in IL-2 induction.
Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex-serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mM NaCl or lipoplexes with high ( greater than 33 mol%)
An exception is the Bcl-3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in th nucleus.
Implications for type III secretion function
These chimeras were cotransfected with the hCG beta gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells.
tal-1 transcription within exon 4.
Recombinant fish neurotrophin-6 is a heparin-binding glycoprotein: implications for a role in axonal guidance.  Neurotrophin-6 (NT-6) was identified in the teleost fish Xiphophorus as a new member of the neurotrophin gene family.
Study of biochemical substrate and role of metalloproteinases in fascia transversalis from hernial processes.
Erasure of methylation imprinting of Igf2r during mouse primordial germ-cell development.
We previously reported that a number of viral genomes, including human immunodeficiency virus type
(RSS) heptamers present in the V(D)J region of the T lymphocyte receptor gene.
HIV-1 harboring mutations within two C/EBP sites were crippled in their ability to replicate in U937 promonocytic cells, indicating that these sites are required for replication.
Primers were designed to amplify all V-J rearrangements, including VJ1, VJ2, VJ4, and VJ5.
HIV-1 Nef protein inhibits the recruitment of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in human T-cells.
The present data thus highlight that PtdIns 3-kinase and Akt/PKB are not universal Ras effector molecules.
Overexpression of UDG in Saos 2 cells was observed to delay growth late in G1 phase and transiently arrest these cells from progressing into the S phase.
Transient overexpression of Bcl-2 in mouse and human T cell blasts did not block Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas
Repeats-in-toxin (RTX) and other toxins
The variants display differential effects on catalytic rate and substrate binding, implying that partial inhibition or selective inhibition with regard to HIFalpha isoforms of PHD2 could result in the phenotype displayed by patients with familial erythrocytosis.
Human Zic protein was immunohistochemically detected in the nuclei of the cerebellar granule cell lineage from the progenitor cells of the external germinal layer to the postmigrated cells of the internal granular layer.
Mutations in the three known genes of the KCNQ branch of the K+ channel gene family underlie inherited cardiac arrhythmias (in some cases associated with deafness) and neonatal epilepsy.
The remaining 86% correspond to unknown genes of which 92% have been confirmed to be differentially expressed.
Thus, although GATA3 and FOXP3 showed similar kinetics, their expression polarizes at the end of the differentiation process when cells were cultured towards Th2 or iTreg cells, respectively (Figure 4A and 4B).
To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence diversity on LTR-directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and immune system, we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV-1-infected peripheral blood.
These results are discussed in the context of the ras-signalling pathway.
