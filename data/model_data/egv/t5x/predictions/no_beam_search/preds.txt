['Enhanced IL-2 transcription correlates with increased c-fos synthesis and increased Fos content of AP-1.']
['Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA (Figure 11).']
['HTPB was a cell cycle-regulated inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor--cyclin E/CDK2 inhibitor--cyclin E/CDK2 complex-dependent kinase (CDK2-1) inhibitor.']
['Initial signaling through the CD4 receptor played a major role in the sensitization of HIV-infected cells to undergo apoptosis.']
['In contrast, neither the RA-stimulated, RARE-mediated transcription nor the induced RAR-beta expression was suppressed by VitD3, suggesting that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid-induced differentiation program but not the RARE-mediated signal.']
['Here we have reconstituted ligand-dependent activation of the receptor to a DNA-binding form by using the dioxin receptor and its bHLH-PAS partner factor Arnt expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate.', 'Whereas ligand-binding activity correlated with association with hsp90, bHLH-hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA-binding activity but not for dimerization.']
['As assessed with mutagenized promoters, the most important IL-2 cis-regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP-1 site and the NF- kappaB site.', '(B cells) or B7-negative (endothelial) accessory cells, are mediated through the same cis-elements.']
['Genes most significantly represented in this program are those with roles in cell growth and proliferation>protein synthesis']
['To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL, CD95, TNFalpha, or doxorubicin, NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha.']
['p107/p130 deficiency triggered a dramatic loss of E2F4 nuclear localization as well as transcriptional derepression, which is suggested by nucleosome mapping studies to be the result of localized hyperacetylation of nucleosomes proximal to E2F-binding sites.']
['Administration of exogenous polyamines prevented ACA-induced apoptosis represented by a reduction in the number of apoptotic bodies and also caused reduction in the induced caspase-3-like protease activity at 8 h. These findings suggest that the anticarcinogenic effects of ACA might be partly due to perturbation of the polyamine metabolic pathway and triggering of caspase-3-like activity, which result in apoptosis.']
['Overexpression of Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) induces cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells.']
['Therefore, we next examined the effect of DMI on Ca3/7 cells, resistant to growth inhibition by the synthetic glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA).']
['Moreover, other genes involved in cell movement mimic FN1 expression induced by Snail1 or TGF-beta1 treatment and recruit p65NF-kappaB and Snail1 to their promoters.']
['The Foxp3 promoter oligonucleotide was also shown to be necessary for maximal expression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T cells, as well as in HEK 293T cells, which are heavily preincubated with Foxp3 (Figure 7B).']
['We previously identified a Fas ligand (fasL) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 (PILOT) but not Egr-1 (NGFI-A, Krox-24, Tis-8, and Zif-268) induces transcription of fasL.']
['HL-60 cells were found to express mafK mRNA, indicating the presence of endogenous IFN in the cells.']
['This suggests that FOXO3a may play a role in LAC suppression by eliciting a protective response to carcinogenic stress.']
['In stably transformed erythroblasts coexpressing the v-erbA oncoprotein and the c-erbA/T3 receptor at an approximately equimolar ratio, c-erbA activity is dominant over v-erbA.']
